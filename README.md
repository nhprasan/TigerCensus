# TigerCensus
This repository extends Microsoft's "CameraTraps" project to tackle individual tiger identification (re-identification or ReID) using deep learning. Building on the "Pytorch-Wildlife" framework, it employs advanced neural networks to distinguish individual tigers from images captured in the wild, based on unique stripe patterns.
